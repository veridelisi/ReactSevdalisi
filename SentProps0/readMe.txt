1).
Data comes from data.js
Please look at data.js 
This is very cool and simple method fshort databases
In this sample we have only 5 persons and their datas

2).
We have datas and we need to arrange these datas
App.js is our landing(center) page
We import data from Data.js (import data from "./data";)
We also import List.js page (import List from "./List";) because we will sent datas to List.js
This is very simple
data is created in data.js, importing in App.js, sending to List.js

3).
We create useState (    const [datas, setDatas] = useState(data);  )
Importing data is converting useState object as datas
We sent this state object to List.js as props   ( <List info={datas} />     )

4).
In the List.js takes this props and converts to takenData      (    const takenData= props.info;   )


List.js seperates takenData with map function and We can see each parts of every item in database.

{takenData.map((item)=> (
      <>
      <h1>{item.id}</h1>
      <h2>{item.age}</h2>
      <h3>{item.name}</h3>
      <h4>-----------------</h4>
      </>
    )
